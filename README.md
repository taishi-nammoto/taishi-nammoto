# Taishi Nammoto.
I'm Taishi Nammoto from Japan, and I do content on Natural Language Processing and Data Visualization. I really enjoy learning new machine learning models and training them with the data I collect. I like data scraping as well as learning machine learning, and so I will contribute to GitHub by providing data I collect and machine learning models trained with the data.
